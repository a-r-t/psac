# PSA Compressor version .37 Decompiled

This really should've been open source from the beginning.

This project is written in C#. For development, 
I recommend downloading and installing [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/),
selecting "Open Project/Solution", and then selecting the file `PSACompressor.csproj`. Visual Studio should take care of the rest.

I haven't touched anything besides fixing the project's build XML to include the `CharSpecific` and `Data` folders
to copy to the build path to make things easier. Otherwise, it is untouched.

I will be making a new PSA application, and would love if anyone has any suggestions for features 
or would like to help me. Instead of having to reinvent the wheel, I decompiled this source code so I would
have access to moveset parsing logic. My plan is to document everything as best I can as I develop the new
application for the future.

Note: I did not write this application, it was created by user ICLPX from Brawl Vault, I don't know anything
about the person other than nobody can get in contact with them and that they don't speak English. It's an
amazing tool, however the source code not being available has always been a huge issue.

If you have any questions feel free to reach out to me, I'm catscatscats99 on Discord/BV.
